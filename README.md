# Domain Coloring
Domain Coloring is a program for visualizing complex functions via [domain coloring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_coloring). 
There are customizable settings, but it's also quite simple to use and generates beautiful graphs.

Domain Coloring uses [fbs](https://build-system.fman.io/) to build binaries and installers. 
It uses [PyQt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/) for its user interface and a mixture of Pillow and pygame to visualize the graphs.

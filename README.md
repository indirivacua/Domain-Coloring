# Domain-Coloring
Domain-Coloring is a program for using [domain coloring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_coloring) to visualize complex functions. It uses PyQt5 for the user interface and a mixture of Pillow and pygame to visualize the graphs.

Domain-Coloring uses [fbs](https://build-system.fman.io/) to build binaries and installers.
